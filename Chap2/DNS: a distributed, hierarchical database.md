**Instructor (On Camera):** Welcome to our online course on DNS, the Domain Name System! Today, we're going to explore one of the fundamental aspects of DNS – its distributed and hierarchical database structure. By the end of this module, you'll have a clear understanding of how DNS works and why it's structured the way it is. Are you ready? Let's dive in!

**[Slide 1: Title]**
*"DNS: A Distributed, Hierarchical Database"*

**Instructor (Voiceover):** DNS, short for the Domain Name System, is like the global phonebook of the internet. It's distributed and organized hierarchically, which is what makes it so efficient and scalable.

**[Slide 2: The DNS Query Process]**
*"The DNS Query Process"*

**Instructor (On Camera):** To understand how this works, let's take an example. Imagine you want to find the IP address for www.amazon.com. The DNS resolution process typically involves multiple steps, and it's distributed across various DNS servers.

**[Slide 3: Step 1 - Querying the Root Server]**
*"Step 1: Querying the Root Server"*

**Instructor (Voiceover):** The first step is initiated by the client, which is your computer or device. It queries the root DNS server to find the DNS server responsible for the top-level domain, in this case, ".com."

**[Slide 4: Step 2 - Querying the TLD DNS Server]**
*"Step 2: Querying the TLD DNS Server"*

**Instructor (On Camera):** In the second step, the client queries the ".com" Top-Level Domain (TLD) DNS server. This server has information about all domain names ending with ".com." It directs the client to the DNS server responsible for "amazon.com."

**[Slide 5: Step 3 - Querying the Authoritative DNS Server]**
*"Step 3: Querying the Authoritative DNS Server"*

**Instructor (Voiceover):** In the final step, the client queries the authoritative DNS server for "amazon.com." This DNS server has specific information about the domain "amazon.com," including the IP address of www.amazon.com.

**[Slide 6: Conclusion]**
*"In Conclusion"*

**Instructor (On Camera):** This distributed and hierarchical structure of DNS has some significant advantages. It allows for efficient and scalable domain name resolution, making the internet accessible and responsive. Each level of DNS server is responsible for a specific part of the domain namespace, which reduces the load on individual servers.

**[Closing Remarks]**

**Instructor (Voiceover):** And there you have it – a closer look at how DNS operates as a distributed, hierarchical database. This knowledge is crucial for anyone looking to understand the inner workings of the internet. If you found this module insightful, stay tuned for more lessons where we'll delve deeper into DNS and its fascinating components.
